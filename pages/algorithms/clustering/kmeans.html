        <p style="color:yellow; font-size:24px;">Explanation of K-Means Clustering :</p>
        <p>K-Means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solves the clustering problem. It groups
            all the objects in such a way that objects in the same group (group is a cluster) are more similar (in some
            sense) to each other than to those in other groups. For example, assume you have an image with a red ball on
            the green grass. K-Means will split all pixels into two clusters. The first cluster will contain the pixels
            of the ball, the second cluster will contain the pixels of the grass.IRIS Dataset is a table that contains
            several features of iris flowers of 3 species. Species can be "Iris-setosa", "Iris-versicolor", and
            "Iris-virginica". Each flower contains 5 features: Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and
            Species.</p>
