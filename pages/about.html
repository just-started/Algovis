      <h3>Idea Of Visualizing Algorithms</h3>
      <span>August 2018</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">Most of the Algorithm visualisation projects deliver an abstract visualization where
        the main criteria would be to analyze the performance of an algorithm. But we wanted to focus on delivering a
        learning experience to the student.</p>

      <h3>Implemented Linear Search And Binary Search Visualizations</h3>
      <span>14/10/2018</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">With the help of setInterval(Func(), millisec) function in the JavaScript were able to
        develop the Linear Search and Binary Search Visualizations. </p>

      <h3>Implemented Bubble Sort Visualization</h3>
      <span>4/11/2018</span>
      <p>It was not easy to implement bubble sort. Visualizing it as taught in the classroom made it hard to
        implement. But it became easy once we made designs beforehand on how the entire visualization must look.</p>

      <h3>Merge Sort Visualization Was Implemented</h3>
      <span>19/11/2018</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">Merge Sort was the Hardest of all. It took a long time to code it as it contains a lot
        of steps in the visualization and required a lot of debugging. But we made it through by using
        setTImeout(Func(), millisec) function which executed each step at a specified time. You can look at the code <a
          style="color: bisque;" href="https://github.com/karthikchiru12/Algovis/blob/master/js/mergesort.js">here</a>.

      <h3>Algorithm Trace Was Added And Other Improvements Made</h3>
      <span>December 2018</span>
      <p>We wanted to make the visualizations to be more than just mere animations. So we added the algorithm trace while the
        visualization is running to provide the exact step of algorithm that is being visualized. </p>

      <h3>K Means Clustering Visualization Was Integrated</h3>
      <span>03/02/2019</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">We were having a course "Data Mining" while we were doing the project. And we thought
        it would be awesome if we visualize one of the algorithms explained in the course. We found out that there was
        an awesome visualization already done and it was open source. So we integrated it into our project and
        customized it accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Optimized Bubble Sort Visualization Pull Request Was Merged</h3>
      <span>03/03/2019</span>
      <p>Mr.Prasad Shiva was fascinated by the project. He forked the Algovis repository in the Github and
        modified existing Bubble sort and made Optimized Bubble Sort visualization out of it. He made a pull request and
        we merged the pull request.</p>

      <h3>Several Computer Science Cheatsheets Were Added</h3>
      <span>01/05/2019</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">As our motto goes "Anything is easy to learn if it is visually presented in a simple
        way. So we will strive to make learning simple and more exciting".
        So we created various cheatsheets and uploaded them onto the site.</p>

      <h3>CrossBrowser Bugs Were Fixed, Theme Was Updated And Lot Other Improvements Were Made</h3>
      <span>05/06/2019</span>
      <p>Our website didn`t work correctly with Firefox and other browsers. But we decided to make it right by working
        on Major changes to the project and making it cross-browser compatible. We also moved from the old theme to an
        exciting new Dark theme. And accordingly, many other changes were made.</p>

      <h3>Newly A Datasets Section Was Added</h3>
      <span>28/06/2019</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">We wanted to even add some of the data we collected for analyzing career trends to the
        project. So we created a datasets section where we host the public datasets which are created by the data
        collected by us.</p>

      <h3>Selection Sort Visualization Added And Also Pause And Resume Functionality Added.</h3>
      <span>06/07/2019</span>
      <p>We developed and added Selection sorting algorithm visualization. From a very long time, we wanted to provide
        pause and resume functionality. But we ignored that due to the complexity involved in it. But today we used the
        confirm() function in javascript that stops the execution of the page. It is a silly workaround, but it makes
        the visualizations greater.</p>

      <h3>Jekyllified The Whole Site  And White Theme Added</h3>
      <span>08/07/2019</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">Mr. Sri Pravan Paturi forked the Algovis Repo and Jekyllified the site in order to
      make the development of future builds easy. And also based on a survey 90% were happy with the dark theme but, the rest of 10% wanted a white theme. So we
      Added the option to shift themes.</p>

      <h3>Local Binary Pattren Visualization Was Added</h3>
      <span>03/08/2019</span>
      <p>We developed and added Local Binary Pattren Visualization. This was rather an easy one to do, but it may be useful.</p>

      <h3>Insertion Sort Added</h3>
      <span>01/09/2019</span>
      <p style="direction: ltr;">Insertion Sort Visualization is added and this is by far the most complex visualization developed. You can see the visualization code in <a href="https://github.com/karthikchiru12/Algovis/blob/master/js/insertionsort.js" style="text-decoration: none; color:wheat;">here</a></p>
