# Algovis
<br>
<br>
Algovis, An Experiment to visualize the algorithms imitating the conventional classroom approach.<br>
Which are dynamic in a way that enables any novice student to understand the algorithms effectively.
<br>
<br>

We have developed Algorithm visualizations for below Algorithms currently: <br>
1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Bubble sort
4. Optimized Bubble sort
5. Merge sort 
6. Insertion sort (Under Development)
7. Selection sort (Under Development)
8. K Means Clustering

You can download the code from Algovis git repository: https://github.com/karthikchiru12/Algovis <br>
Download the zip and extract it.<br>
Run the index.html and you are good to go without any other requirements.<br>
Feel free to experiment and change a line of code here and there and see what changes happen. <br>

#### If stuck ?
1. If the animation is stuck or not starting, then clear the cache of the browser and restart the browser.
2. Even then if it does not work then try using a different browser.

<h5>NOTE :</h5> <p><b> All visualizations are tested in browsers that use chromium engine. All visualizations work perfectly in the chromium based browsers.
Other browsers show some issues and are not displaying all visualizations correctly.</b></p>

You can see the visualizations we had developed at   https://chiranjeevikarthik.me/Algovis/

#### Update:
Several Cheatsheets for various CS subjects are added.
